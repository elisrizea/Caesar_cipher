# **Description:**
    Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of     
    the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which       
    each letter in the plain text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For  
    # example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named  
    # after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
